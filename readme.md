# UnitSprite2CGE

> **UnitSprite2CGE** is a lightweight utility designed for processing *spritesheets*.

The main function of this application is to **read the `.meta` files** generated by the **Unity** game engine for 2D sprites. Using this information, the utility **extracts and separates the individual sprites** from the original image file (typically in PNG format).
